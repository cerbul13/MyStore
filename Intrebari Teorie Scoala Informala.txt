URI	- A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or 
	physical resource used by web technologies.
URL	- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web
Cookie - A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web browser that the website can retrieve at a later time. Cookies are 
	used to tell the server that users have returned to a particular website. When users return to a website, a cookie provides information and 
	allows the site to display selected settings and targeted content.
	Cookies often store your settings for a website. When you return to the site, the browser sends back the cookies that belong to the site. 
	This allows the site to present you with information customized to fit your needs.
	Cookies can store a wide range of information, including personally identifiable information (such as your name, home address, 
	email address, or telephone number).
DLL	- Dynamic Link Library - A DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time
Class	- A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a class combines the fields and methods
	(member function which defines actions) into a single unit.
Abstract Class - Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes. 
	An abstract class has methods that are not implemented, and that derived class will implement. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
	A class needs to be declared abstract in order to have abstract members.
	Not all methods of an abstract class needs to be abstract.
	Abstract class can have constructors.
Sealed Class - Is a class that cannot be inherited by any class but can be instantiated. The design intent of a sealed class is to indicate that 
	the class is specialized and there is no need to extend it to provide any additional functionality through inheritance to override its behavior.
Static Class - can only contain static data members including static methods, static constructors, and static properties
	Static classes cannot be instantiated
	A normal non static class can contain static members.
Partial class - It provides a special ability to implement the functionality of a single class into multiple files and all these files are combined into 
	a single class file when the application is compiled
Enum 	- (also called enumeration) is a user-defined value type used to represent a list of named integer constants
Extension methods - enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type
This - in extension methods - extension method is a static method of a static class, where the "this" modifier is applied to the first parameter.
This - is used to refer to the current instance of the class 
This - This keyword is used to call another constructor from a constructor in the same class
Static method - A static method in C# is a method that keeps only one copy of the method at the Type level, not the object level. That means, all 
	instances of the class share the same copy of the method and its data.
Static class - A static class contains only static members, cannot be instantiated , is sealed and cannot contain instance constructors.
Override - is used to mark a method that provides a new implementation of the method inherited from a base class.
Access Modifiers in a class - public, protected, internal, private, protected internal
	Public - you have access to public members from outside the class
	Protected - you have access to protected members from within the class or within the inherited class
	Private - you have acccess to private members only from within the class
	Internal - the access is limited to the assembly in which it is declared
	Protected internal - is used to specify that access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class
Default access modifier of a class - private
Interfaces - Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the 
	declaration of the members. The implementation of the interface's members will be given by class who implements the interface 
Interfaces - don't contain fields because fields represent a specific implementation of data representation, and exposing them would break encapsulation.
Interfaces - defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface
Interfaces - all members of an interface are public
Interfaces - contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement
Interfaces - C# allows the user to inherit one interface into another interface.
Properties - Property in C# is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism for classes to expose private fields. This can be done with the use of accessors.
	Properties can be used to model/validate data that reach the private fields. 
Automatic Properties - you do not have to define the field for the property, and you only have to write get; and set; inside the property.
Read-Write Property - standard property where you can read or write a value for that property
Read-Only Property. - read only proerties can only be read, and therefore they only have getter accessor. A value can be set in the constructor
Static Property. - A static Property can be used to access only the static members of the class.
Indexer Property - An indexer is a special type of property that allows a class or a structure to be accessed like an array for its internal collection.
Using 	- is used to import namespaces at the top of a code file, that will be used within the code
	- is used to to specify a block of code (used also for try catch) where the specified class that is instantiated and that implements IDisposable 
	interface will be disposed of at the end of the block of code.
Encapsulation - is the packing of "data" and "functions operating on that data" into a single component and restricting the access to some of the object's components.
	- Encapsulation solves the problem in the implementation level.
	- Encapsulation is the mechanism by which the abstraction is implemented.
Abstraction - Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.
	- Abstraction solves the problem in the design level
	- Abstraction is a process. It is the act of identifying the relevant qualities and behaviors an object should possess.
Polymorphism - Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance and we povide 
	different functionality by using the override directive.
Polymorphism - Can be static or dynamic. Static is achieved by methode overloading, which means compile time polymorphism. Dynamic/Runtime Polymorphism 
	can be achieved by method overriding.
Inheritance - is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically.
Const vs Readonly - ReadOnly is a runtime constant. Const is a compile time constant. The value of readonly field can be changed. 
	The value of the const field can not be changed. The value of a readonly field can be changed at declaration or in the constructor of that class
Imutable strings - strings are imutable because their size cannot be modified. In order to modify the size of a string a new string is allocated by the compiler.
	In order to use a string that has the option to modify their size use stringbuilder instead.
Imutable strings - why - imutable arrays are thread safe. Allows for compiler optimisations. They also provide size optimisation. Is safe to use them as method params.
Method signature - is a unique identification of a method for the C# compiler. The signature consists of a method name and the type and kind (value, reference, or output) 
	of each of its formal parameters. Method signature does not include the return type.
Constructor - is a special method of the class which gets automatically invoked whenever an instance of the class is created.
	Is used to initialize the private fields of the class.
Casting - there are 2 types of casting in c#
	Upcasting = implicit casting, means converting a smaller/child class type to a larger/parent type class.
	Dwoncasting = explicit casting, means converting a larger/parent class type to a smaller/child type class.
Boxing 	- is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. Boxing is implicit.
Unboxing- extracts the value type from the object. Unboxing is explicit.
Nullable- a nullable Type is a data type is that contain the defined data type or the null value
Objects and string types have a default value of null
Default value of an int is 0
Default value of a float is 0.0
Default value of a decimal is 0.0M
Default value of bool is false.
Stack vs Queue	- The Queue class tracks objects on FIFO basis, while the Stack class tracks objects on LIFO basis.
Custom Exceptions - define and use custom exceptions if you're building a library or framework, and you want consumers of that library to react to 
	exceptions from the library differently than they would do for built-in exception types.
Contract preconditions and input validation have similar but still different purpose. While input validation ensures that your system is protected from 
	the outside world, contract preconditions guard your code inside of your system and help you quickly locate and fix bugs in it.
Exception properties - includes a number of properties that help identify the code location, the type, the help file, and the reason for the exception. 
	The list of properties is: StackTrace, InnerException, Message, HelpLink, HResult, Source, TargetSite, and Data
Object class - is the base class for all the classes in . Net Framework
Assembly - is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. Assemblies take the form 
	of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (. dll) files, and are the building blocks of . NET applications
Namespace - keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects. You can use a namespace to organize code elements and to 
	create globally unique types
Object - an instance of a class that is created dynamically
Multiple inheritance is not allowed in C#. The purpose behind multiple inheritance can be achieved by the implementation of multiple interfaces.
Interface Explicit Implementation - Explicit implementation is used to resolve cases where two interfaces each declare different members of the 
	same name such as a property or a method. To implement both interfaces, a class has to use explicit implementation either for the property 
	P, or the method P, or both.
Interface variable types - you are allowed to create a reference variable of an interface type or in other words, you are allowed to create an 
	interface reference variable
GET Request - A GET request is a way for you to grab data from a data source with the help of the internet. It’s done using the GET request method, 
	which is a very common HTTP request method
HTTP Request - is divided into three parts: Request line, header and body.
HTTP Response - is also divided into three parts: Status line, header and body.
Query String - is a part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that assigns values to specified parameters. The keys-values pairs are specified after the ? in the URL.
HTTP Request Verbs - GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,DELETE,CONNECT,OPTIONS,TRACE,PATCH
CRUD - stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
Convention over Configuration - (or coding by convention) is a term that when a convention, or code pattern, is implemented by a tool to match the desired behavior, 
	it behaves as expected without the use of any configuration files
MVC	- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.
Controller - contains the flow control logic for an ASP.NET MVC application. A controller determines what response to send back to a user when a user makes 
	a browser request. A controller is written as a class
Array - is a structure representing a fixed length collection of values or objects with the same type.
MVC Model - contains all of your application logic that is not contained in a view or a controller. The model should contain all of your application business 
	logic, validation logic, and database access logic.
Abstract class vs Interface 
	- abstract class can have members implemented
	- abstract class can have different access modifiers for their members while interfaces have only public access modifiers.
	- a class can inherit a single abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.
	- an abstract class can contain constructor while an interface cannot contain constructor.
	- an abstract class can contain fields while an interface cannot contain fields.
Value Data Type - short, int, char, float, double
Reference Data Type - String, Class, Object and Interface
Pointer Data Type - Pointers
Literals - are the fixed value used by a variable that is predefined and cannot be modified during the execution of the code
Dependency injection - A dependency is an object that another object depends on. Dependency Injection (or inversion) is basically providing the 
	objects that an object needs, instead of having it construct the objects themselves.
Dependency Inversion - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that a high-level class must not depend upon a lower level class. 
	They must both depend upon abstractions
SOLID Principles - 
	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
	Open Closed Principle (OCP)	      - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)   - The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without 
						breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects 
						of your superclass.
	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. In order to achieve this is best to 
						use multiple smaller interfaces instead of a bigger one that is not entirely used.
	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that a high-level class must not depend upon a lower 
						level class. They must both depend upon abstractions. And, secondly, an abstraction must not depend 
						upon details, but the details must depend upon abstractions.
Unit testing - The three sections of unit testing are arrange, act and assert.
Unit testing vs Integration testing - Unit testing is a testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are ready to use, 
	whereas Integration testing checks integration between software modules.
